Elasticsearch is a high-performance, distributed search engine. It can deliver real-time search results and operates smoothly in a cluster, ensuring that if a node is busy or disconnected, data can be redistributed to prevent downtime.

Communication with Elasticsearch is through a REST API, allowing flexibility for usage from any platform.
