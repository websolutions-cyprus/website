Symfony is the "rock" of [PHP]({{< ref "technologies/php" >}}). It offers hundreds of reusable, tested components to boost productivity and improve application quality.

It also provides a framework (web framework) that guides you in developing your web application using best practices.

Today, it's rare to find a modern PHP web application that doesnâ€™t use at least some Symfony components.
