## Mobile Application Development
Flutter is an open-source Software Development Kit (SDK) that enables you to create user interfaces.

We primarily use it to build mobile applications.

Flutter is the first and currently the only solution to effectively address the longstanding issue of cross-platform compatibility. It compiles to native code for each device, achieving optimal performance. It can run on Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, Fuchsia OS (Googleâ€™s new operating system), and even in a web browser.
