Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework that compiles your code into pure JavaScript at build time, making it extremely fast. Unlike traditional frameworks, it doesnâ€™t use a virtual DOM, leading to smoother performance and smaller bundle sizes. We use Svelte for highly responsive and lightweight web applications.
