Kubernetes, or K8s for short, is an open-source system developed by Google, with its name derived from the Greek word "κυβερνήτης" (governor).

Kubernetes is designed for computing systems of all sizes, from Raspberry Pi to entire data centers and cloud computing setups. It operates on clusters rather than individual computers.

A K8s cluster connects multiple computers into a single network to share application data, enabling an application to scale resources as needed (infinitely scalable).
